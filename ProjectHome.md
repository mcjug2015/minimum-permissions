20120804 - Released a version of LM compatible with tablets and 4.0+ devices.

20111203 - About to release the beta version of [LocationMailer](https://market.android.com/publish/Home#AppEditorPlace:p=org.mcjug.locationmailer) to the android marketplace. Hope it goes well.


M-P aims to provide free android applications that only ask for permissions they need to work. So a file system browser won't require unlimited internet access and an alarm widget isn't going to demand access to your contact list.

20101126 - Coding has began, so far I got simple examples of location retrieval and email sending working.
